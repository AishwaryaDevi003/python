# Write a Python program that takes a paragraph as input and counts how many numeric values (like 123, 4.5, etc.) appear in it using regular expressions.

# Example Input:
# text = "I bought 3 apples, 4.5 kg of mangoes, and 3 more oranges. Total: 7.5 kg."
# Expected Output:
# {'3': 2, '4.5': 1, '7.5': 1}
